# ECC-Based Industrial SCADA Security Simulation

This project implements a cybersecurity framework for protecting HMI–PLC communication in industrial control systems using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).

The simulation models a cyber–physical industrial plant under Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks and demonstrates how ECC-based authentication and anomaly detection can intercept malicious commands in real time.

## Project Overview

Industrial automation systems rely on secure communication between Human–Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). Legacy SCADA protocols often transmit commands in plaintext, making them vulnerable to interception, replay, and tampering.

This project proposes a lightweight ECC security architecture that:

- establishes secure key exchange
- digitally signs control commands
- detects MITM attacks
- blocks tampered messages before execution
- measures detection latency and interception rate

The framework is evaluated using a configurable industrial plant simulator.
